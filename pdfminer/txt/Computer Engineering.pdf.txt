Electrical and Computer Engineering

Program: B.S., Computer Engineering

Program Description
“Nowadays the world is lit by lightning,” playwright Tennessee Williams wrote. But electrical and computer engineers prove him wrong every
day.

From city lights to satellites, semiconductors, telephone switching systems and audio equipment, their work depends on electricity and the
engineers who design and develop ways to harness its power.

The Computer Engineering (CompE) program bridges the curriculum gap between Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. Computer
Engineers deal with the hardware and software aspects of computer system design and development. The CompE curriculum contains
components of both the Computer Science and Electrical Engineering programs.

Computer Engineering majors receive a broad knowledge in the basic curriculum. Among the many covered topics are mathematics, physics,
chemistry, biology, electrical circuits, engineering economics, algorithms, programming and computer organization. Computer Engineering
students will take coursework in a number of areas (i.e., computer architecture, digital design) from both the software and hardware points of
view, allowing a broader, more complete exposure to the subject. Additionally, these curricula will be unified in the one year senior design
project course bringing together the existing Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science programs.

The ECE department has 17 labs associated with its ECE classes. In the labs, students work alongside professors who may be designing medical
instrumentation for healthcare, designing microcontroller-based applications, developing pager and satellite communications systems, or
working on innovations in electrical power systems.

All students in the EE or CompE programs take part in the department’s senior design program, modeled on industry work groups that
students will encounter on the job. Like professional engineers, students design and develop a project from conception through manufacture.
In the process, they gain valuable experience in working as a team and dealing with personalities, as well as technical areas.

Senior design projects have included national intercollegiate competitions. Students compete in designing a micromouse and training it to run
through a 10-square-foot maze. Students also work on interdisciplinary teams to design, build, program and test an unmanned autonomous
helicopter. Other projects include developing a sophisticated stereo system, a control system for a satellite tracking antenna, a television
tuner, fabrication of a hybrid circuit, software-defined radio, etc.

Program Requirements
The Computer Engineering program is based on an expectation of adequate high school preparation in science, mathematics and English.
High school courses should include algebra, plane geometry, trigonometry, chemistry or physics (all desirable), and four years of English.

CSUN provides the opportunity for students who have not had a complete background of pre-engineering work in high school to take courses
to prepare for the major. These additional courses will not count toward the major and may increase the time to graduate. CSUN provides
testing as outlined below to ensure that students start their engineering coursework at an appropriate level.

Placement Exam Requirements

1. The Mathematics Placement Test (MPT) is required prior to enrollment in MATH 150A. Students should take this exam before enrolling in
their classes so they may be placed in the appropriate mathematics course. Students with scores of 4 or 5 on the AP Calculus AB or BC tests
are exempt from the MPT.
2. If Computer Engineering majors elect to take CHEM 101 to satisfy their science elective requirement, the Chemistry Placement Test (CPT)
is required with a score of 40 or higher prior to enrolling in CHEM 101. Students who have had high school chemistry and expect to enroll in
CHEM 101 must take this test regardless of their score on the AP Chemistry exam. Students who do not receive this CPT score must receive
a grade of “C” or better in CHEM 100 before taking CHEM 101.

Special Grade Requirements

1. All students must complete the lower division writing requirement before enrolling in 300-level engineering courses.
2. All students must attempt the Upper Division Writing Proficiency Exam before enrolling in 400-level engineering courses.
3. A grade of “C-” or better is required in all courses in the major. A grade of “C” or better is required in all undergraduate transfer courses.
4. Senior-level courses cannot be taken unless the student previously completed or is concurrently completing all freshman-, sophomore-
and junior-level core requirements.
5. A grade of “C” or higher is necessary in MATH 150B to meet the prerequisite requirements for the next-level math courses.
