IEEE Standards documents are developed within  the Technical 
Committees of  the  IEEE  Societies  and  the  Standards Coordinating 
Committees of  the IEEE Standards Board. Members of  the committees 
serve voluntarily  and without compensation. They are not necessar- 
ily members of  the  Institute. The standards developed  within  IEEE 
represent a consensus of  the broad expertise on the subject within the 
Institute  as well  as  those  activities  outside  of  IEEE  which  have 
expressed  an  interest  in  participating in  the  development  of  the 
standard. 

Use of  an IEEE Standard is wholly voluntary. The existence of  an 
IEEE Standard does not imply that there are no other ways to produce, 
test, measure, purchase, market, or provide other goods and services 
related to the scope of the IEEE Standard. Furthermore, the viewpoint 
expressed at the time a standard is approved and issued is subject to 
change brought about through developments in the state of the art and 
comments received from users of  the standard. Every IEEE Standard 
is subjected  to review at least  once  every five years for  revision  or 
reaffirmation. When a document is more than five years old, and has 
not been reaffirmed,  it is reasonable to conclude that its contents, al- 
though still of  some value, do not wholly reflect the present state of the 
art. Users are cautioned to check to determine that they have the latest 
edition of  any IEEE Standard. 

Comments for  revision  of  IEEE  Standards are welcome  from  any 
interested  party,  regardless  of  membership  affiliation  with  IEEE. 
Suggestions for changes in documents should be in the form of  a pro- 
posed change of text, together with appropriate supporting comments. 

Interpretations:  Occasionally  questions  may  arise  regarding  the 
meaning of  portions of  standards as they  relate  to  specific  applica- 
tions. When the need for interpretations is brought to the attention of 
IEEE,  the  Institute  will  initiate  action  to  prepare  appropriate  re- 
sponses.  Since  IEEE  Standards  represent  a  consensus  of  all  con- 
cerned interests, it is important to ensure that any interpretation has 
also received the concurrence of  a balance of  interests. For this reason 
IEEE  and the members  of  its technical committees  are not  able to 
provide an instant response to interpretation requests except in those 
cases where the matter has previously received formal consideration. 
Comments on  standards and requests for interpretations should be 

addressed to: 

Secretary, IEEE Standards Board 
345 East 47th street 
New York, NY 10017 
USA 

IEEE Standards documents are adopted by the Institute of Electrical 
and  Electronics  Engineers without regard  to whether  their  adoption 
may involve patents on  articles, materials, or processes.  Such adop- 
tion  does not  assume  any liability to any patent  owner, nor  does it 
assume  any  obligation  whatever to  parties  adopting  the  standards 
documents.

(This Foreword is  not  a part of the IEEE Standard Computer Dictionary: Compilation of  IEEE Standard Computer 

Glossaries.) 

The computer field is continuing to expand. New terms are being generated and new meanings 
are being adopted for existing terms. The IEEE Computer Dictionary project  was undertaken to 
document this vocabulary. Its purpose is to identify terms currently in use in the computer field 
and  to  establish  standard definitions for these terms.  The dictionary is intended to serve as a 
useful reference for those in the computer field and for those who come into contact with computers 
either through their work or in their everyday lives. 

The  dictionary  is being  developed as a  series  of  subject-area  glossaries,  each  approved  and 
published as it is completed. This edition of  the dictionary contains all terms and definitions from 
the glossaries published to date. The IEEE designations and subject matter of  these glossaries are 
as follows: 

IEEE Std 1084 l610.11-1986  Mathematics  of  Computing Terminology 
IEEE Std 610.2-1987 
IEEE Std 610.3-1989 
IEEE Std 610.4-1990 
IEEE Std 610.5-1990 
IEEE Std 610.12 [7291-1990  Software  Engineering Terminology 

Computer Applications Terminology 
Modeling  and  Simulation Terminology 
Image Processing and  Pattern  Recognition Terminology 
Data  Management  Terminology 

The remaining glossaries in  the series are listed below.  Future editions of  the dictionary  will 
contain  terms  and  definitions from  those  glossaries  that have  been  published  at the  time  of 
dictionary  compilation. 

P610.6 
P610.7 
P610.8 
P610.9 
P610.10 
P610.11 
P610.13 

Computer Graphics Terminology 
Computer Networking and Data Communications Terminology 
Artificial  Intelligence  Terminology 
Computer Security and Privacy Terminology 
Computer Hardware  Terminology 
Theory of  Computation Terminology 
Computer Languages Terminology 

Every  effort  has been  made  to use  definitions from established  standards in  this dictionary. 
When existing standards were found to be incomplete, unclear, or inconsistent with  other entries 
in the dictionary, however, new, revised, or composite definitions have been  developed. 

At the time of publication  of this document, the following people form the steering committee of 

the Computer Dictionary working group:

IEEE Standard Computer Dictionary 

A Compilation of IEEE Standard Computer 

Glossaries 

This  dictionary  is  a  compilation  of  IEEE 
standard  glossaries  covering  the  fields  of 
Mathematics of  Computing, Computer  Appli- 
cations,  Modeling  and  Simulation,  Image 
Processing  and  Pattern  Recognition,  Data 
Management,  and  Software  Engineering. 
Terms from other areas of  the computer field, 
including Computer  Graphics, Computer Net- 
working  and  Data  Communications,  Artifi- 
cial  Intelligence,  Computer  Security  and 
Privacy,  Computer Hardware, Theory of  Com- 
putation,  and  Computer  Languages  will  be 
added in later editions. 

Every  effort  has been  made  to  include  all 
terms  within  the  designated  subject  areas. 
Terms were excluded if  they were  considered 
to be  parochial to one group or  organization; 
company proprietary  or  trademarked;  multi- 
word  terms whose  meaning could be  inferred 
from the  definitions of  the  component words; 
or terms whose meaning in the computer field 
could be  directly  inferred from their  standard 
English  meaning. 

2. Dictionary stnrcture 

Entries  in  the  dictionary  are  arranged 
alphabetically,  with  the  six  constituent glos- 
saries  merged  into  a  single,  alphabetical 
presentation. An  entry may consist of a single 
word, such as “byte,” a phrase, such as “image 
processing,”  or  an  acronym,  such  as “ADP.” 
Phrases are given in their natural order (data 
dictionary)  rather  than  in  reversed  order 
(dictionary,  data). 

Blanks  precede  all  other  characters  in  al- 
phabetizing. Hyphens and slashes are treated 
as blanks. Alternative  spellings are shown in 
parentheses. 

13 

If  a term has more than one definition,  the 
definitions  are  numbered.  In  most  cases, 
noun  definitions are given  first, followed by 
verb  and  adjective definitions  as  applicable. 
When  a definition  applies only to a particular 
area, such as data management, that context is 
indicated at the start of  the definition.  Exam- 
ples, notes,  and illustrations have been added 
to  clarify  selected  definitions. 

The  following cross-references are  used  to 
show a term’s relationship  to other terms in the 
dictionary: 

Contrast  with refers to a term with an oppo- 
site or  substantially different meaning. 
Syn refers to a synonymous term. 
See also refers to a related term. 
See refers to a preferred term  or to a term 
where the desired definition can be found. 
The  word  “deprecated” indicates a term  or 
definition  whose  use  is  discouraged  because 
such  use  is  obsolete,  misleading,  or  ambigu- 
ous. ”DoD” refers to usage by  the U.S.  Depart- 
ment of  Defense.
