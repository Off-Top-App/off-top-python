Computer Information Technology, B.S.

Computer Science

Program: B.S., Computer Information Technology

Program Description
The B.S. degree in Computer Information Technology (CIT) is designed for students who are interested in a professional career that involves
solving the informational technology infrastructure needs of companies and organizations. An IT professional is able to understand computer
systems and solve the computer-related problems of the people they serve. An IT professional assumes responsibility for selecting, installing
and maintaining hardware and software products to meet organizational culture and needs. The Computer Information Technology degree
consists of a set of core requirements plus a Domain Emphasis Package that is effectively a minor in another field of study. The program
focuses on the technology and service aspects of the industry rather than information content. Graduates of the program will have an applied
knowledge of such fields as web programming, system infrastructure, databases, networking, e-business, project management, data center
management, security and information assurance.

Program Requirements
The B.S. in Computer Information Technology program requires a total of 120 units, including General Education requirements, major core
courses and a 15-unit sequence of elective courses referred to below as the Domain Emphasis Package. To graduate, a student must complete
a minimum of 18 residency units from the list of upper division required courses listed below in addition to all other institutional residency
requirements.

Special Grade Requirements

No grade lower than a �C� will be accepted on transfer from another institution to satisfy the graduation requirements in Information
Technology. Where specific grade requirements are not specified, no CSUN grade lower than a �C-� will be accepted for courses required in
the B.S. CIT program.

4. Domain Emphasis Package (15-18 units)

Computer Information Technology is pervasive and its use is found throughout nearly all areas of human endeavor. A major objective of the
B.S. CIT program is to prepare graduates to work effectively with individuals from other disciplines and to apply information technology (IT) to
these disciplines. To this end, students in the B.S. CIT program are required to engage in an in-depth study of some subject that uses
computing in a substantive way and that emphasizes collaboration and communication with other individuals.

This requirement can be satisfied by completion of one of the following:

a. Completion of an appropriate minor at CSUN that does not include courses offered by the Department of Computer Science or the
College of Business and Economics. The intent of the minor is to focus studies in an application domain in which the graduate plans to start
a career. Students interested in focusing their studies on business are advised to explore the Information Systems degree options offered by
the Department of Accounting and Information Systems. A minor must consist of at least 18 units, but some requirements in a minor might
also be applied toward meeting General Education requirements.
b. Completion of a cohesive set of classes, called the Domain Emphasis Package, determined though consultation with the student�s faculty
advisor and requiring approval by the department chair prior to enrollment in any course contained in the package. This package should
focus on a specific IT or application domain. Such a package shall consist of 15 units, with no more than 6 units of lower division classes
chosen strategically to meet the prerequisites of the other classes also included in the package. The package cannot contain courses
offered by the College of Business and Economics.

By the time COMP 110/L is completed, B.S. CIT majors must meet with a faculty advisor to determine the classes in a customized domain
emphasis package or to select a minor to fulfill the Domain Emphasis requirement.

5. General Education (48 units)

Undergraduate students must complete 48 units of General Education as described in this Catalog.
18 units are satisfied by coursework in the major. Completion of the Computer Information Technology major satisfies A3 Critical Thinking. 6
units of Physical Science or Life Science may be used to satisfy sections B1-3. MATH 103 or MATH 150A or MATH 255A satisfies Basic Skills B4
Mathematics/Quantitative Reasoning; CIT 360/L satisfies B5 Scientific Inquiry and Quantitative Reasoning; and COMP 110/L satisfies E Lifelong
Learning.

Total Units in the Major: 86-94

Student Learning Outcomes
Students graduating from the B.S. CIT program will be able to:

1. Analyze a complex computing problem and apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
2. Design, implement and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the
program�s discipline.
3. Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts.
4. Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles.
5. Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program�s discipline.
6. Identify and analyze user needs and to take them into account in the selection, creation, integration, evaluation and administration of
computing-based systems.
