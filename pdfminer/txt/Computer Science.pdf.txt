Computer Science

Program: B.S., Computer Science

Program Description
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
>>>>>>> master
The B.S. degree in Computer Science provides a broad knowledge of computing and is designed for students who desire: (a) to pursue
graduate work in computer science and (b) to work on the development and support of software projects in a diverse range of specialized
areas. The Computer Science degree consists of a set of core courses and a 15-unit senior electives package. The core of the program covers
programming languages, computer system organization, operating systems, data structures, software engineering, computation theory and
societal implications in computing. The senior electives package allows students to specialize in such fields as artificial intelligence, embedded
applications, networking, gaming, graphics, software engineering and security.

Program Requirements
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
>>>>>>> master
The B.S. in Computer Science program requires a total of 120 units, including General Education requirements, major core courses and a 15-
unit senior electives package. To graduate, a student must complete a minimum of 18 residency units from the list of upper division required
courses listed below in addition to all other institutional residency requirements.

Special Grade Requirements

A grade of “C” or better is required in both GE Analytical Reading/Expository Writing and Oral Communication. Carefully check course
prerequisites as many courses in the major require grades of “C” or better in prerequisite courses.

No grade lower than a “C” will be accepted on transfer from another institution to satisfy Computer Science requirements. Where specific
grade requirements are not specified, no CSUN grade lower than a “C-” will be accepted for courses required in the Computer Science
program.

b. Select an additional science course with corresponding lab outside of the sequence

selected above (4-5 units)

BIOL 106/BIOL 106L Biological Principles I and Lab (3/1)
CHEM 101/CHEM 101L General Chemistry I and Lab (4/1)
GEOG 101/GEOG 102 The Physical Environment and Lab (3/1)

GEOL 110/GEOL 112 Earth and Life through Time and Lab (3/1)
PHYS 220A/PHYS 220AL Mechanics and Lab (3/1)

3. Upper Division Required Courses (24 units)

Before taking upper division courses in Computer Science, students must be admitted to the Computer Science major/minor programs, the
Computer Information Technology major program, the Computer Engineering major program or the Information Systems/Information
Technology major program.

Note: All students must attempt the Upper Division Writing Proficiency Exam prior to enrolling in any 400-level Computer Science course. The
Upper Division Writing Proficiency Exam must be passed prior to enrolling in COMP 490/L.

COMP 310 Automata, Languages and Computation (3)

COMP 322/L Introduction to Operating Systems and System Architecture and Lab (3/1)

COMP 333 Concepts of Programming Languages (3)

COMP 380/L Introduction to Software Engineering and Lab (2/1)

COMP 482 Algorithm Design and Analysis (3)

or MATH 482 Combinatorial Algorithms (3)

COMP 490/L Senior Design Project and Lab (3/1)

COMP 491L Senior Project Lab (1)

Select one of the following:

MATH 340 Probability (3)
MATH 341 Applied Statistics I (3)

4. Upper Division Electives (15 units)

Computer Science majors are required to take 15 units of senior electives.

The senior electives must consist of 15 units of 400- or 500-level courses in Computer Science (not COMP 450, 480/L, 482, 490/L, 491L, 494
or 499). The electives may include MATH 481A (Numerical Analysis) as 3 of the 15 units.

Requests for taking a 400- or 500-level course as a senior elective that does not meet the requirements stated above must be approved by the
student’s faculty advisor and by the department chair prior to enrollment in the course.

It is strongly recommended that students discuss their career goals with an advisor prior to selecting their senior electives. The advisor will
suggest appropriate courses for the student to consider.

5. General Education (48 units)

Undergraduate students must complete 48 units of General Education as described in this Catalog.
18 units are satisfied by coursework in the major. Completion of the Computer Science major satisfies A3 Critical Thinking. 6 units of Physical
Science or Life Science may be used to satisfy sections B1-3. MATH 150A satisfies Basic Skills B4 Mathematics/Quantitative Reasoning; COMP
310 satisfies B5 Scientific Inquiry and Quantitative Reasoning; and COMP 110/L satisfies E Lifelong Learning.

Total Units in the Major: 87-89

General Education Units: 30

Additional Units: 1-3
